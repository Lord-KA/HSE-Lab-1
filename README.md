# Sparse Matrix
This is an abstract library implementing a class of sparse matrices of arbitrary objects with basic linear algebra operations and Treap data structure for storing elements.

## Building
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build 
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make
```

## TODO
1. Multithreading for operators
2. Move from Treap to Skip list
3. Add multithreading to Skip list too
